osx上默认的pip貌似没安装，然后，又自带了一个python，所以有下面三个方法。

#### #code
```
# brew
#
brew install python

# easy_install
#
sudo easy_install pip

# get-pip.py
#
# downloading get-pip.py. Be sure to do this by following a 
# trusted link since you will have to run the script as root.
# https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
#
sudo python get-pip.py
```
